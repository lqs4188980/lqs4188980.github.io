ORM	
=========	

Generally, all the ORM system should contain below components:	
+ DB Engine: For building database connections and translate query into SQL or some query statements.	
+ Model Definition Syntax: Describe how to define data models and how these models are mapped from definitions to real tables.	
+ DB Session (optional): Describe how to manage DB sessions, maybe automatically managed by ORM system.	
+ Query Syntax: About how query statements are organized.

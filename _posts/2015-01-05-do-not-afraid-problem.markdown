We cannot live without problems.    
The meaning of work is discover the problems and solve them. Why the earth circle the sun? Why the hydrogen can burn with oxygen and fire? We discovered these problems and solve them, then the physics and chemistry got evolution.   
However, when we solve problems, we are usually trying to prevent problems. When I wrote some programs, I was always tried to prevent logic flaws. That's important. We don't want to bring new meaningless problems when we are solving a meaningful problem.  
We want to discover and solve meaningful problems.  

Well, I'm afraid problems. I'm not really **afraid** of problems; I'm afraid of punishment.     
Punishment is scary. We usually evaluate the cost and benefits of solving a problem before taking actions. We cannot accept the cost of solving a problem greater than the benefits from solving it.    
What a luck, we can quantify the cost and benefits for many of the problems. Thus we can easily decide whether solving the problem or choose a correct way to solve it. 
But not every thing can be quantified. You cannot quantify psychology effect and future cost/benefit.   
That's really bother me. I want to prevent problems as much as possible. I have no patient to wait until the tomorrow become today.     
Really need calm down.
